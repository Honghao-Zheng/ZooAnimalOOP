### This is an example project to the use of abstraction, interface and implementation the four pillars of OOP which are 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation 
- Abstraction

The place where they are applied can be 
seen from the comment in the project.

The project created a few classes 
named after animals in the zoo.
And it contains the root class which
is called **Animal** and subclass 
called **Tiger** and **Peack**. **Tider** 
extends abstract class called **Mammal** 
having **Animal** as its superclass 
, and implements interfaces called 
**CanAttack** and **CanRun**. **Peack** 
directly extends **Animal** and implements
**CanRun**.
